Gonna experiment w/ https://github.com/gilesbowkett/archaeopteryx/

The goal is to take a song and run it through a markov model to generate new music based on the original. 

Some todos in no particular order:
1. Read from sheet music
2. Use different instruments instead of simply playing the notes as written / make it symphonic
3. Choose probabilities in some smart way to provide to Arkx (right now it's just 100% play this note)
4. Mixing multiple songs
5. MIDI as input and output
